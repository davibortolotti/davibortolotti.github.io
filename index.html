                <p>The abolition of slavery in 1865 led to new opportunities
                 for the education of freed African Americans.
                 Although strict segregation limited employment opportunities
                 for most blacks, many were able to find work in entertainment.
                 Black musicians were able to provide entertainment in dances,
                 minstrel shows, and in vaudeville, during which time many
                 marching bands were formed. Black pianists played in bars,
                 clubs, and brothels, as ragtime developed.

                <p>Ragtime appeared as sheet music, popularized by African-
                American musicians such as the entertainer Ernest Hogan,
                whose hit songs appeared in 1895. Two years later, Vess
                Ossman recorded a medley of these songs as a banjo solo
                known as "Rag Time Medley".
                Also in 1897, the white composer William H.
                Krell published his "Mississippi Rag" as
                the first written piano instrumental ragtime piece, and Tom
                Turpin published his "Harlem Rag", the first rag published
                by an African-American.</p>
